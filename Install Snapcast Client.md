# Snapcast Client Installation Guide ðŸŽµðŸ”§

Follow these steps to install Snapcast Client on your Raspberry Pi and seamlessly connect it to your audio system:

**Before executing the commands, go to [Snapcast Releases](https://github.com/badaix/snapcast/releases) and copy the location of the latest snapclient installer file. Ensure the file name includes "armhf" for Raspberry Pi's ARM processors. Replace `snapclient_x.xx.x_armhf.deb` in the commands below with the correct version.**

1. **Download Snapclient Installer:**
   ```bash
   wget https://github.com/badaix/snapcast/releases/download/v0.11.0/snapclient.xx.x_armhf.deb
   ```

2. **Install Snapclient:**
   After downloading the file, execute the following command to install the software:
   ```bash
   sudo dpkg -i snapclient_x.xx.x_armhf.deb
   ```

3. **Install Missing Libraries:**
   After installation, run the following to install any missing libraries:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get -f install
   ```

4. **Restart Raspberry Pi:**
   Restart the Raspberry Pi using the following command:
   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

5. **Configure Snapclient:**
   Edit the snapclient configuration using the following command:
   ```bash
   sudo vi /etc/default/snapclient
   ```

6. **Check Status:**
   Check the status by running the following command:
   ```bash
   systemctl status snapclient
   ```

7. **Restart Raspberry Pi Again:**
   After executing the above commands, restart the Raspberry Pi:
   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

8. **Troubleshooting - Cookie Errors:**
   If you encounter errors like "cookies not found in `/var/lib/snapclient/.config/pulse`," copy cookie files from `~/.config/pulse` to the respective folder:
   ```bash
   cd /var/lib
   sudo mkdir snapclient
   sudo chmod 777 .
   cd snapclient
   sudo mkdir .config
   sudo chmod 777 .
   cd .config
   sudo mkdir pulse
   sudo chmod 777 .
   cd pulse

   cd ~
   cd .config
   cd pulse

   sudo cp *.* /var/lib/snapclient/.config/pulse
   sudo cp * /var/lib/snapclient/.config/pulse
   ```

   Restart snapclient after copying the cookies:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart snapclient
   sudo systemctl status snapclient
   ```
