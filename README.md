## Software Components 🖥️
Utilize Mopidy, Snapcast server, and client software for seamless audio distribution. Mopidy acts as the media player, and Snapcast facilitates broadcasting to multiple clients.

1. [Install Mopidy](https://github.com/skalavala/Multi-Room-Audio-Centralized-Audio-for-Home/blob/master/Install%20Mopidy.md)
2. [Install Snapcast Server](https://github.com/skalavala/Multi-Room-Audio-Centralized-Audio-for-Home/blob/master/Install%20Snapcast%20Server.md)
3. [Install Snapcast client on each Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/skalavala/Multi-Room-Audio-Centralized-Audio-for-Home/blob/master/Install%20Snapcast%20Client.md)
4. [Setting up PulseAudio](https://github.com/skalavala/Multi-Room-Audio-Centralized-Audio-for-Home/blob/master/Setup%20Pulseaudio.md)
5. [Setting Snapcast Client Names](https://github.com/skalavala/Multi-Room-Audio-Centralized-Audio-for-Home/blob/master/Naming%20Clients.md)  
6. **Optional:** [Enable Airplay](https://github.com/skalavala/Multi-Room-Audio-Centralized-Audio-for-Home/blob/master/airplay.md)
7. **Optional:** [Setup Virtual Sound Card on VMWare ESXi 6.0 or Above](https://github.com/skalavala/Multi-Room-Audio-Centralized-Audio-for-Home/blob/master/vmware.md)

All set! 🎉 Enjoy the whole house audio system, play music, connect to home assistant, make announcements, or even integrate with online radio channels!

Optionally, install Mopidy Web Extensions for Spotify playlists. Integrate Mopidy with [Home Assistant (HA)](http://www.home-assistant.io) to view media players on the dashboard (Note: HA supports older versions of Snapcast server and clients).

## Additional Enhancements 🌟
